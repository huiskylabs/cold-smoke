// texture of baked light: for every texel how far it lies under the shadow of the snow that stands toward the sun, how much sky the walls
// round it hide, and which way the snow slopes. The far one (the same texels over 51.2 m) keeps the trail going up the hill behind. Every step each ski presses in ALL the
// snow it covered while it came that step: a flat ski leaves a trench, a ski on edge a slot with one clean wall and a pressed ramp, a ski
// going sideways a wide scraped floor with a berm of pushed snow along its leading side. The terrain reads the maps as light and, round the
// skier, as real relief (04_terrain.js). Whatever lies more than 'keep' metres from the skier is wiped, so the tracks of one tile back never
